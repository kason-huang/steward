"""Skill execution: turn a Prediction Receipt's plan into timed actuator commands.

Motion uses only the robot's own estimates (odometry, encoders, ES). Base motion ramps a
position setpoint along each path segment at a bounded speed in simulation time taken from sensor
stamps; joints settle to targets with one sag correction. Control ticks follow the world clock when
one is given, so a skill moves the same at every simulation speed. A stop request interrupts
the current skill between control ticks and holds the current pose.
